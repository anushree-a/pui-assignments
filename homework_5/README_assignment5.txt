Extra work done in this assignment for bonus credit:

1. Created an About page that is accessible via the link in the navbar
2. Created a Contact Us page that is accessible via the link in the footer
3. Created 2 separate product detail pages: 
   One for available item and one for an item that is out of stock. 
   Both have slightly different designs based on product availabililty.
   You can access the available product details page by clicking on a product
   that is in stock on the browse page.
   Similarly, you can access the out of stock product details page by clicking on a product
   that is out of stock on the browse page.
